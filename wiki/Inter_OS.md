### The story

Inter OS is Bence's long-long first PPTOS project...
The first creation of Inter OS was created in 2018 in PowerPoint 2003 with over 380+ slides and terrible UI. Unluckily, Bence lost the file and they didn't make anything until early 2020, when they had online classes, then Bence joined to the PPTOS Community. So, in 2020, Bence started working on the second version of Inter OS, but then, PowerPoint could not open the file, so Bence had to restart again, and after the 3rd try, Bence worked on the 4th Inter OS, but of course, in newer PowerPoint. Bence got some negative feedback on the UI, because that wasn't the best and with their unique desktop design... and a startup sound made by them in MuseScore; lots of apps were ready, but Bence decided to not continue it, because it was useless, and then they did their biggest mistake ever... Bence **removed** the file :(
**Pro tip: Never delete your old files!**
So, Bence started Nexton, which is another cancelled PPTOS.
