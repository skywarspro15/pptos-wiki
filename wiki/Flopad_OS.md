### flopad

Omnia is a simple Desktop Environment Emulator. You can use it to derive UI/UX design inspiration, learn the fundamentals or programming, or even build your own concept.

### Flopad OS1

Geraneia was the first concept by The Omnia Project. (Known as Flopad in 2015) The remastered version delivers the same excitement, 5 years later, with much better quality and some new features.

### Flopad OS3

</p>

#### A Series of Continuous Improvements

From 2015 to 2021, Nebula has been abandoned multiple times. However, each and every step of progress was critical for both Omnia and Flopad OS future versions. Nebula will be a tribute to Flopad OS, as well as the very last major release for the series.
