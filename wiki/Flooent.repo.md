### Operating Systems

#### Bindows

Bindows was a series of (apparently rip-off) products mocking Microsoft Windows.

| Product Name              | Released                      | Status                        |

| Bindows 11                | 2016                          | Never given any support, could've been the future of Bindows|

| Bindows 1.01/BubbleSoft Interface Manager| 2016           | Never given any support       |

It was developed from 2014-2016 until flooent.repo decided to cease the project entirely, due to being obviously a rip-off.

#### TreygenOS

After Bindows's descontinuation, flooent.repo decided to make a followup to Bindows and make it better. This obscure version was actually released, But we never got to see it completely.

| Product Name              | Released                      | Status                        |

| TreygenOS Pre-Alpha       | 2018                          | Never given any support       |

This version is currently lost, And it can not be found anywhere.

#### Bobcat

After Bindows's descontinuation, flooent.repo tried to enter the "business" market with Bobcat, Which is supposed to be a more robust operating system based on it's scratch code.

This operating system can be found in the Legacy Repository.

| Product Name              | Released                      | Status                        |

| Bobcat Build 4081         | 2016                          | Never given any support       |
| Bobcat Build 4089         | 2018                          | Never given any support       |

#### SimpleDOS

SimpleDOS is just a version based off Bindows 8 but slimdown, there is also a basic version which is barebones, but made from scratch.

This version can be found in the official ZaphkielCorp site.

| Product Name              | Released                      | Status                        |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| SimpleDOS Bindows 8 Pre-Beta| 2015                        | Discontinued                  |
| SimpleDOS 1.02            | 2015                          | Discontinued                  |

#### MoonConsole

MoonConsole is flooent.repo's entrance into the gaming PowerPoint market. It was obviously based off Metro's appearance on Windows 8 and had added Bindows Media Center from Bindows 10.

#### BubbleSoftOS

BubbleSoftOS is the first "made out of scratch" operating system from flooent.repo, It was a concept of being a Android-based operating system, with technically including Android 7.

This version is forever lost.

#### BubbleSoftXP/ZaphkielXP/modernXP

modernXP, flooent.repo's latest product, Was developed after BubbleSoftOS was finished. The concept of this OS is to bring Windows XP with a new sleek look, And making their own base. The first versions of modernXP had a problem with the resolution, due to the objects being too big. Nevertheless, They managed to put a store and a internet browser.

Currently, modernXP is being developed and there is a new teaser on their channel.
